PRE-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THREADMAKER MACRO:
First, find your FreeCAD Macro directory (https://wiki.freecad.org/How_to_install_macros#Macros_directory).

Second, download or copy the ThreadMaker.zip file into your macro directory, and extract it there.  If you 
already extracted it somewhere else, the move the files (and the ThreadMaker sub-folder) into the FreeCAD 
Macro directory.  To de-clutter your Macro directory, you can move the readme and PDF user guide to wherever
you keep your FreeCAD reference materials.

Lastly, read the ThreadMaker User Guide (TMUserGuide.pdf) to quickly learn to generate threaded fasteners 
for ISO 261 standard threads, or generate any other kind of threads based on the ISO 68-1M thread profile.
